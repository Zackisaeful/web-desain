In the far north of Subang, West Java, lies a gem called Cirewang Beach. The name may be unfamiliar to some, but not to anglers and now, seekers of a different kind of vacation experience. Since its designation as a tourist destination in mid-2013, Cirewang, which was originally inhabited by only 32 families, has begun to take off. More than just a sandy beach, Cirewang holds a unique story of embossed soil, the beauty of dense mangrove forests, and an adventure to this hidden paradise. Let's take a peek at its charm through the eyes of local residents, like Pak Suharsa, whose life has been helped by this tourism boom.

Cirewang: A Gift of Embossed Land and Natural Fortress Cirewang Beach, also known as Teluk Sidaon or Cipta Semalam Beach, has a uniqueness that is rarely found. The main attraction is Tanjung Cirewang, a 500m² embossed land that extends for more than 1km. This land began to form about 13 years ago (around the year 2000), which used to be an ocean. The presence of this embossed land not only creates a beautiful stretch of sand, but also serves as a natural barrier from the crashing waves of the North Sea, making the surrounding waters calm and ideal for fishing, as Mr. Suharsa found out while looking for crabs. The Adventure to Cipta Beach Overnight: Crossing the Mangroves One of the things that makes Cirewang so special is the access to the beach. To be able to enjoy the beauty of the sand, visitors must take a fishing boat along the river for about 1 km that cuts through the lush mangrove forest. This boat trip is not just a means of transportation, but part of the adventure itself. The boat service fee from the parking lot in Cirewang Village to the beach is only Rp15,000 per person. As Mr. Suharsa said, "This is what makes Cirewang unique. To get to the beach, visitors must first take a boat through the mangrove forest, where else is there? "Tourism Impact for Local Residents The tourism boom in Cirewang has had a positive impact on local residents, including Mr. Suharsa. In addition to his activities as a fisherman, now he also often picks up tourists who come. This certainly adds to his family's income. “Now during the day I sometimes like to pick up visitors who come here, it's not bad, in the past during the day I usually fished in the middle of the sea,” he said. The beach has become widely known, even attracting thousands of visitors during the Lebaran holiday yesterday, which shows the great potential of Cirewang as a tourist destination. Location and Residents' Expectations Administratively, Cirewang is located in Pangarengan Village, Legon Kulon Sub-district, Subang Regency. To reach it from the Pamanukan intersection, simply drive north about 13 km. Local residents are hoping that the road access to their village will be improved soon so that more tourists can visit and have a unique experience at Cirewang Beach.

Cirewang Beach is not just another vacation destination. It's a unique blend of natural wonders (embossed land and mangrove forest), an unforgettable adventurous experience while cruising down the river by boat, and the hospitality of the locals. With all its features, Cirewang offers a new hope for the people of Subang who want to enjoy a safe sandy beach.
